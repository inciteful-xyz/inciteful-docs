# What is Inciteful?
Inciteful is a new take on the process of searching through academic literature and, as such, can be a bit confusing at first.  The hope is that after a quick tour through these pages you'll get the hang of it quickly. 

The site was built from the ground up to be flexible.  That means whether you are just skimming or a power user, you should be able to accomplish what you need.  

## Getting Started
The documentation is broken up into pieces based on what you are trying to accomplish.  

* Go straight to the [Quick Start](quick-start) section if you are the type who just wants to dive right in and figure it out as you go.
* The [Use Cases](use-cases) section will go in depth into different ways of using the Inciteful.
* The [How Does Inciteful Work?](how-does-it-work) section is for you if you want to get into the nitty gritty.
